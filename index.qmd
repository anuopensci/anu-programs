- The edges show the prerequisite required for the course.
- The color of nodes are such that:
  - blue are courses listed in the study options 
  - yellow are required but not listed in the study options
  - red are courses that don't seem to exist anymore
- You can zoom in to see more information.
- Clicking on the node takes you to the ANU course homepage.
